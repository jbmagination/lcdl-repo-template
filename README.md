# LC-DL repo template
[LC-DL](<https://github.com/sinceohsix/lcdl-repo>) (short for LiveContainer Downloader) is an iOS shortcut for use with [LiveContainer](<https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer>) that allows you to easily install apps from the internet. This repository is a template with special tooling to help you make your own LC-DL repository. It is most similar to [AltStudio](<https://altstudio.app>).

Please note that this project is still a work in progress, and many of the features that this repository claims to have are not yet available.

## Special thanks
Thank you to [@sinceohsix](<https://github.com/sinceohsix>) for creating LC-DL! He also helped with this project slightly; specifically, he helped with getting data folders working with the example app listings.

## Setup
If you don't already have a GitHub account, you can make one at <https://github.com/signup>. You'll need to be logged in with your account to see the button to use this template. If you're using this template in a GitHub organization, make sure that they [allow use of GitHub Actions for your repository](<https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization>).

Once you've logged in, you can select the green "Use this template" button, then choose "Create a new repository" from the dropdown.<br>
> [!WARNING]
> Do not fork this repository to use the template! It might not work as expected!

*The next instruction doesn't work yet. Currently, the instructions that would automagically appear are visible.*
<br>
Afterwards, please wait a few minutes for your repository to be automagically updated with the remaining instructions.
